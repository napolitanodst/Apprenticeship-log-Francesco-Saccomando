# Apprenticeship Log
### Neural Networks
In the [Neural Networks](https://github.com/napolitanodst/Apprenticeship-log/tree/Apprenticeship-Code/Neural%20Networks) directory are contained all the attempts to create a simple geological Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) wich classifies rock micrographies into 3 classes: Metamorphic, Sedimentary and Volcanic.

The final version is named **kFoldFinale.ipnyb**
### Wiki
In the [wiki](https://github.com/napolitanodst/Apprenticeship-log/wiki) section can be found all the daily steps toward the completion of the code along with, useful papes and useful datasets found during the research.
### Dataset
The dataset used in the Neural Network is the [Photomicrograph dataset of rocks for petrology teaching in Nanjing University](https://www.scidb.cn/en/detail?dataSetId=732953783604084736), appropriately and manually resized to fit the simple model of Neural network used.
