### Neural Networks
In the [Neural Networks](https://github.com/napolitanodst/Apprenticeship-log/tree/Apprenticeship-Code/Neural%20Networks) directory are contained all the attempts made to create a simple geological Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) wich classifies rock micrographies into 3 classes: Metamorphic, Sedimentary and Volcanic.
The model has been coded and trained on Google [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/),using the base resources provided by the platform.

The final version is named [**kFoldFinale.ipnyb**](https://github.com/napolitanodst/Apprenticeship-log/blob/Apprenticeship-Code/Neural%20Networks/kFoldFinal.ipynb)
### Wiki
In the [wiki](https://github.com/napolitanodst/Apprenticeship-log/wiki) section can be found all the daily steps toward the completion of the code along with, useful papes and useful datasets found during the research.
### Dataset
The dataset used in the Neural Network is the [Photomicrograph dataset of rocks for petrology teaching in Nanjing University](https://www.scidb.cn/en/detail?dataSetId=732953783604084736), appropriately and manually resized to fit the simple model of Neural network used.

The train dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19fSejs_bBJXOHll91BfHrzOXt7pf6ex9/view?usp=share_link), the test dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19fSejs_bBJXOHll91BfHrzOXt7pf6ex9/view?usp=share_link).
Both datasets have been uploaded on Google Drive and from here, imported in the Colab Virtual Machine (the code to do this is provided, just make sure to mount Drive on Colab)
